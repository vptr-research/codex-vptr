# Day 2 - 2026-02-07

## What I Did Today
Finished C00 (all exercises) + started C01 (stopped to study pointers)

## Day Type
A (building code)

## What I Learned

### New Skills
- **Printing numbers with 2 digits**: Use division and modulo to split a number
  - Example: 42 → print '4' then '2'
  - `tens = n / 10 + '0'` (gets the first digit)
  - `ones = n % 10 + '0'` (gets the last digit)
  
- **Recursion**: A function that calls itself
  - Used it in `ft_putnbr` to print each digit
  - Needs a "stop condition" or it runs forever
  
- **Special case for smallest negative number**: `-2147483648` can't be made positive
  - If you try, it breaks (overflow)
  - Had to handle it separately
  
- **Helper functions**: Splitting big functions into smaller ones
  - Needed for norminette 25-line limit

### Security Learning
- **Can integer overflow be exploited?** Asked this about `ft_putnbr`
  - Answer: Not in this case (the type system protects it)
  - But in other code, yes (example: using negative number to bypass size checks)
  - Started thinking like a hacker: "where can bad input cause problems?"
  
- **Hacker skills discussion**: Same skills for good guys and bad guys
  - CODEX teaches elite technical skills
  - Your choice determines if you use them legally or not
  - Legal = better money, no risk, long career
  - After CODEX: can reach world-class with 2-3 more years of practice

### Bugs I Fixed

1. **Wrong math in ex05** (when recreating it)
   - **Problem**: Wrote `num2 = num1 + '1'` (adding ASCII codes)
   - **Why wrong**: '0' + '1' = 97, not 1
   - **Fix**: Changed to `num2 = num1 + 1`
   - **Learned**: Be careful with characters vs numbers

2. **Wrong type in ex02** (C01 swap exercise)
   - **Problem**: Used `char *value` to swap integers
   - **Why wrong**: Need `int` not `char`, and pointer wasn't initialized
   - **Decision**: Stop and study pointers first

### Git Mistake
- **Lost my files**: Yesterday didn't add new files after deleting old ones
  - Only the test files survived
  - Had to rewrite ex00-05 from memory (took 15-20 min)
  - **Learned**: Always check `git status` before committing
  - **Learned**: Add new files right after removing old ones

### Smart Decision
- Started C01 ex02 (swap function)
- Realized I don't understand pointers well enough
- **Chose to stop and study instead of guessing**
- Will use: XaveCoding videos + K&R book Chapter 5
- **CODEX idea**: Understanding beats speed

## Proof of Work
- All C00 exercises work and tested
- Git commit: `00682ee` - "C00 complete: ex00-07 all exercises done"
- Started C01 ex00-01 but stopped to study

## Exercises Done Today
- [x] C00 ex06: ft_print_comb2 (print pairs of 2-digit numbers)
- [x] C00 ex07: ft_putnbr (print any integer using recursion)
- [x] C00 ex00-05: All recreated after losing them in git
- [x] C01 ex00: ft_ft (simple pointer)
- [x] C01 ex01: ft_ultimate_ft (pointer with 9 levels)

## C00 Status: DONE ✅

All exercises complete. Ready for C01 after studying pointers.

## Tomorrow
- Study pointers: `&`, `*`, and multi-level pointers
- Watch XaveCoding videos
- Read K&R book Chapter 5
- Draw pointer diagrams on paper
- Come back to C01 when ready

## Things I Noticed
- **Asking security questions naturally now**: "Can this be exploited?"
- **Choosing to study instead of struggle**: Stopped when confused, will study first
- **Git is tricky**: Lost files but learned the lesson
- **Recursion makes sense now**: Functions calling themselves clicked
- **Getting faster**: Rewrote 6 exercises in 20 minutes (took hours the first time)
- **nvim setup working well**: Header insert fixed, cursor in right place
- **English practice**: Asking for corrections when needed
- **Following my own rules**: "No hints" - learning by struggling

## Notes
Day dedicated to finishing C00 and starting pointer study.
