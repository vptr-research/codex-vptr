# Day 1 - 2026-02-05

## CODEX Restart Notice
**This is Day 1 of the restarted CODEX program following V3.4 updates.**

The CODEX methodology has been updated to V3.4 FINAL with significant changes.

**Previous progress has been reset to ensure proper foundation building with the new framework.**

Starting fresh from Piscina (Phase -1) with full V3.4 compliance.

## Artifact
C00 ex00-05: ft_putchar, ft_print_alphabet, ft_print_reverse_alphabet, ft_print_numbers, ft_is_negative, ft_print_comb

## Day Type
A (construction)

## What I Learned

### Technical Skills
- `write(1, &c, 1)` writes 1 byte to stdout
  - First parameter: file descriptor (1 = stdout)
  - Second parameter: address of data (pointer)
  - Third parameter: number of bytes to write
- Loop variables must change or infinite loop occurs
- Nested loops for combinations (3 levels deep in ex05)
- Conditional logic with `if/else` for decision-making (ex04)
- Helper functions to solve norminette 25-line limit

### Bugs Found & Fixed
1. **ex02 infinite loop**: Forgot `reverse_alphabet--` inside while loop
   - **Cause**: Loop variable never changed
   - **Fix**: Added decrement operator
   - **Lesson**: Always verify loop variables are modified

2. **ex05 norminette violation**: Function exceeded 25 lines
   - **Cause**: All logic in one function
   - **Fix**: Extracted `print_numbers()` helper function
   - **Lesson**: Break complex functions into smaller pieces

### Important Insights
- **Type safety in C**: Caller's responsibility, not the function's
  - `ft_is_negative('A')` converts 'A' to 65 (ASCII) automatically
  - No runtime protection against type mismatches
  - This is how C works - not a bug
  
- **Code optimization vs. learning**: 
  - Saw a more efficient variable initialization pattern
  - Chose NOT to copy it - want to understand it myself first
  - Working code > perfect code when learning
  - **CODEX principle: Struggling teaches more than copying**

### Nvim Configuration
- Fixed 42 header insertion to:
  - Remove confirmation prompt
  - Auto-position cursor after header (line 13)
  - Made workflow faster with `silent = true` in keymap

## Evidence
- All exercises compile with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` (no warnings)
- Tests created and passing for ex00-ex05
- Output verified correct for all exercises
- Norminette compliant (ex05 split into 2 functions)

## Exercises Completed
- [x] ex00: ft_putchar
- [x] ex01: ft_print_alphabet  
- [x] ex02: ft_print_reverse_alphabet
- [x] ex03: ft_print_numbers
- [x] ex04: ft_is_negative
- [x] ex05: ft_print_comb

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Continue C00: ex06 (ft_print_comb2) onwards
- Goal: Complete C00 if possible
- Focus: Understanding nested loops and formatting

## Notes
- Writing logic on paper really helps with complex algorithms (ex05)
- Understanding WHY code works is more important than just making it work
- Phase -1 is about building foundation - speed comes later
