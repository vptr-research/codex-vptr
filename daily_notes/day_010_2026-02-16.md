# Day 10 - 2026-02-16

## Artifact
Tmux setup, supplementary materials planning, curriculum integration

## Day Type
A (construction)

## What I Did
- Configured tmux for efficient workflow
- Defined supplementary materials to use alongside CODEX
- Planned integration between CODEX, university graduation, and OSSU

### Important Insights
- Tmux improves session management and multitasking during coding
- Clear supplementary material selection prevents resource overload
- Balancing CODEX with formal education requires intentional planning

## Evidence
- Tmux configured and functional
- Supplementary materials list defined
- Integration plan for CODEX + graduation + OSSU established

## Exercises Completed
- None (planning and setup day)

## Tomorrow's Plan
- C02 ex11: ft_putstr_non_printable
- C02 ex12: ft_print_memory
- Start C03 if time permits

## Notes
- C02 has 2 remaining exercises (ex11 and ex12)
- Foundation work (environment, planning) is essential before deep coding sessions
