# Day 9 | Phase 1 | Type A | 2026-02-03

## Target Artifact
Implement ft_strchr with tests — find first occurrence of character in string.

## Day Type Justification
Type A (Construction) — building specified string search functionality. No discovery target, straightforward implementation following libc contract.

## Study
Read `man strchr` to understand:
- Return value: pointer to first occurrence, or NULL if not found
- Special case: searching for '\0' returns pointer to terminating null
- Function signature: `char *strchr(const char *s, int c)`

## Implementation
Implemented ft_strchr in `projects/libft/src/ft_strchr.c`:
- Loop through string until character found or '\0' reached
- Return pointer to found character using pointer arithmetic (s + i)
- Return NULL if character not found
- Cast result to `char *` to match return type (discards const qualifier)

## Testing
Created `projects/libft/tests/test_ft_strchr.c` with test cases:
1. Character found in string ("Hello" searching for 'l')
2. Character not found in string ("" and "    " searching for 'l')
3. Empty string
4. Searching for '\0' explicitly

All tests pass when compared against libc strchr.

## Debug Evidence
Compilation errors encountered and fixed:

**Error 1: Returning const pointer from non-const function**
```
error: returning 'const char *' from a function with result type 'char *' 
discards qualifiers
```
Fix: Cast return value to `(char *)` to match function signature.

**Error 2: Wrong return value**
Initial attempts returned `c` (the character) or `s` (start of string) instead of `s + i` (pointer to found position).
Fix: Corrected to `return (char *)(s + i)`.

**Error 3: Redundant condition**
Initially had separate branch for `(c == '\0') && (s[i] == '\0')`, but this is covered by `s[i] == c`.
Fix: Simplified to single if/else.

## Failure / Negative Result
Type A day — no discovery target. Construction work only.

## Failure Model Extracted
Type A day.

## Post-Mortem
None required.

## Open Questions
None.

## Tomorrow
ft_strrchr — find last occurrence of character in string (reverse search).
