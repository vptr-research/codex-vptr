# Day 4 - 2026-02-10

## Day Type
Study Day (atypical - no coding)

## What I Did
Studied pointers for 1 hour (review and reinforcement)

## Why No Artifacts
Day was atypical - focused on solidifying pointer concepts before continuing C01.

## Study Focus
- Reviewing pointer basics
- Reinforcing the mental model (arrows and boxes)
- Preparing to continue C01 ex06 tomorrow

## Tomorrow
Resume normal schedule - continue C01 from ex06 (ft_strlen)

## Notes
Sometimes understanding needs time to settle. Taking a study day to reinforce fundamentals before moving forward.
