# Day 5 - 2026-02-11

## Day Type
A (building code)

## What I Did
C01 ex06 complete. Started thinking about ex07.

## Completed
- [x] C01 ex06: ft_strlen (string length using pointer iteration)

## What I Learned
- `ptr++` moves the pointer (arrow advances)
- `(*ptr)++` changes the value at the pointer
- Pointer iteration works because compiler knows type size
  - `char*` advances 1 byte
  - `int*` advances 4 bytes

## Tomorrow
- C01 ex07: ft_rev_int_tab (reverse array in-place)
- Decided against recursion for this one
