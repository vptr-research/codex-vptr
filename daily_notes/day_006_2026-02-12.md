# Day 6 - 2026-02-12

## Day Type
A (building code)

## What I Did
Finished C01 and started C02 (ex00-03 done)

## Exercises Done
- [x] C01 ex07: ft_rev_int_tab (invert array)
- [x] C01 ex08: ft_sort_int_tab (sort array smallest to biggest)
- [x] C02 ex00: ft_strcpy (copy a string)
- [x] C02 ex01: ft_strncpy (copy only N characters)
- [x] C02 ex02: ft_str_is_alpha (check if all letters)
- [x] C02 ex03: ft_str_is_numeric (check if all numbers)

## C01: DONE

## What I Learned

### Arrays
- Must initialize on one line: int arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
- Going past the end of the array = crash
- Use i < size, never i <= size

### Strings
- char *dest with no memory = crash
- char dest[20] = safe, has space for 20 chars
- Empty string check: str[0] == '\0'
- NULL = pointer that points to nothing
- '\0' = end of a string

### Return Types
- char func() = returns one single character
- char *func() = returns a whole string (pointer)
- Forgetting the * = big problem

### Pattern for is_X functions
- If you find ONE bad character, return 0 immediately
- Only return 1 after checking ALL characters
- Always handle empty string at the start

## Bugs Fixed Today
1. ft_rev_int_tab: Was accessing tab[size] (out of bounds), fixed to tab[size - 1]
2. ft_str_is_alpha: Was returning 1 on first good char instead of checking all
3. ft_str_is_numeric: Had condition backwards
4. Infinite loop: Forgot i++ inside while loop

## Tomorrow
- Continue C02 from ex04
- Goal: Finish C02
