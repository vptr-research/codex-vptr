# CODEX VPTR

This repository documents a long-term, self-designed curriculum
focused on low-level systems and offensive security research.
The goal is to progress from zero knowledge to elite-level capability
through disciplined study, implementation, failure analysis, and
technical writing.

## Scope
- C / C++
- Memory management
- Operating systems internals
- Concurrency
- Exploitation primitives
- Browser security (long-term focus)

## Method
- Daily study and implementation
- Experiments over theory
- Public documentation of progress
- No shortcuts, no hype

## Structure
- `.codex/` - Training methodology documentation
- `projects/` - Major implementations (libft, minishell, etc.)
- `daily_notes/` - Daily work log
- `failure_models/` - Extracted bug patterns
- `warmup/` - Early exercises
- `STATE.md` - Current position tracker

## Notes
This repository reflects real learning.
Mistakes, confusion, and incomplete understanding are expected
and documented as part of the process.
