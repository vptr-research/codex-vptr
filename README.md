# CODEX VPTR

This repository documents a long-term, self-designed curriculum focused on low-level systems and offensive security research. The goal is to progress from zero knowledge to elite-level capability through disciplined study, implementation, failure analysis, and technical writing.

## Scope

- C / C++
- Memory management and heap internals
- Operating systems internals
- Concurrency and synchronization
- Binary exploitation and vulnerability research
- Browser security (long-term focus)

## Method

- Daily study and implementation
- Experiments over theory
- Evidence-based progress (GDB logs, exploit code, sanitizer reports)
- No shortcuts, no hype

## Structure

```
.codex/            - Training methodology documentation
piscina/           - C fundamentals exercises (C00-C13, Shell)
projects/          - Major implementations (libft, printf, etc.)
research/          - CVE reproductions, patch-diff analyses, fuzz results
daily_notes/       - Daily work log
failure_models/    - Extracted bug patterns and security invariants
STATE.md           - Current position tracker
```

## Notes

This repository reflects real learning. Mistakes, confusion, and incomplete understanding are expected and documented as part of the process.

This is a personal training system. Not intended as a tutorial or guide for others.
